sprint automation ( same sprint manual + automation )
n+1 sprint automation ( this sprint manual testing -> automation in next sprint )

Sprint 0 - Inception sprint - Discovery phase ( nearly 1-2/3 months;QA - automation framework creation should start; PO - getting UI mocks/ api req ready)

Sprint 1 - login page (login panel -> username / password /login ) - manual + ( 10 test cases - automation done   )
